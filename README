==============================================================================

  ABOUT:

Flex Serializer allows a easilly integration between .net and Flex, allowing
flex to read and write objects in a compatible format with Microsoft .net.

The format used is the same used in the WCF communication, allowing in future
to write a Flex compatible WCF client totally open source and free.

I was motivated to write this library 'cause I don't found a simple and no so
invasive way to integrate a .net software I was written with flex. Others
library require paid software or which .net write object in a flex compatible
way.

In the future, I will be modificating this library to be more flexible and to
allow it to work with more configuration of the data contracts. Maybe, I will
be writing a Flex WCF Client, if it have feedback and people needing it.

===============================================================================

  KNOW ISSUES:

 * All .net object must have a DataContract namespace declare, and all your
   object must reside in the same namespace.
   
 * All flex object also must have the same namespace.
 
===============================================================================

  TODO:

 * Handle objects in diferent namespaces
 
 * Handle .net custom attributes better
 
 * Handle flex custom metadata better
